/**
 * AI entry points — the nine ways the dashboard can surface its AI Summary / Assistant.
 * Each is a distinct place-and-shape the "Ask AI" affordance can take; the on-board
 * demo bar switches `store.ui.aiEntry` between them, one at a time, so the team can
 * compare them live. Every entry ultimately opens the same grounded AI Assistant
 * panel (or, for `card`, expands the summary in place).
 *
 * Derived from the competitor teardown (Amplitude, Stripe, Seline, Pipedrive, Rows,
 * Salesforce — see the Figma "Dashboards with AI" file) + docs/AI Capabilities…pdf.

// The shortlisted entry points (after review). The side panel is the shared destination
// every entry opens into — not a tab. Per-widget "Ask AI" is now an always-on default on
// each tile, not a demo option. The prompt-bar and topbar-sparkle demos were cut.
