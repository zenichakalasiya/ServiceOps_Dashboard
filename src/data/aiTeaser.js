 * verdict with the readings, the drivers and the consequence; What-needs-attention
 * returns a ranked list where every item carries why it matters and what to do. Anything
 * that merely summarises was dropped: the hover card already says what a widget shows, so
 * a third CTA repeating it spends a slot on something the user gets for free.
 *
 * Neither label carries a "with AI" suffix — they sit under the sparkle, which says it
 * once for the whole group. */
